# Travel Planing Assistant
## Goals
The big data analysis in transportation industry has shown great importance in travel planning and distribution. 

In this project, we propose a travel planning system that predicts the traveling cost and taxi pick-up hotspots from large sets of NYC taxi data. 

## Achievements
In order to achieve the best prediction in New York City area, we studied and implemented machine learning models using __Spark's MLlib__ including: 

    1. Random Forest Regression; 
    2. Linear Regression; 
    3. K-Nearest Neighbor.    
Finally, the best trained model from each algorithm are combined to build the Travel Planning System Website. 
Experimental results demonstrate the correctness of our proposed method for travel planning and cost prediction. 

## Demo
A presentation and demo could be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/cQYM8tW7dcg)

## Business Value
    1. Users could use the prediction to avoid rush hours to take taxi based on their specific location
    2. Police Department could use this prediction on daily basis to deploy their police to ease the traffic
    3. Users could use the cost prediction model for an estimation of traveling cost on specific time
    4. Taxi Companies could use the prediction model for developing long-term policies for taxis distribution
