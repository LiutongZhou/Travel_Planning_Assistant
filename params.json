  "body": "## Why Carpool?\r\n\r\nNYC is the busiest city on Earth! Countless Taxi trips happen everyday. Imagine  two people travel at the same time from the same place to the same destination, they can actually ride only one taxi insdead of two. \r\n\r\nBut! They don't know each other... They ride two taxis seperately.. And they make the roads more congested by adding a taxi on the network...\r\n\r\n## Carpool or Not Carpool?\r\n\r\nBut is it necessary for travelers/comuters in NYC to carpool? Does Carpooling help improve the traffic condition?\r\nThe following is a person trip happened in the first week of June 2015.\r\n\r\nframe1\r\n\r\n## Where to Start with?\r\n\r\nWe analized the June 2016 [NYC Taxi Trip Records](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) and find out:\r\n\r\n![Distribution of Taxi Trips Count][3dhist]\r\n![Taxi Trip Frequency by Location][2d frequency]\r\n\r\nand we decided to focus on these **Hot Areas**, where there must be numerous taxi trips happening every day\r\n![Hot Areas][contour hot]\r\n\r\nSo we choose this region for our test:\r\n\r\nframe 2\r\n\r\n## How to Maximize the Total number of Carpooled trips\r\nAn integer programming model\r\nPDF insertion\r\n\r\n## How to Solve the Model\r\n\r\nWe have created an NYC Taxi Trip Carpooling Assitant using Matlab, which can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/LiutongZhou/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Carpooling-Assistant/releases/tag/1.0). \r\n \r\nThe source codes are published on Github\r\n\r\nWe used May 1 2016 records as the input data for this App. And the results are shown below:\r\n\r\n![Paired Trips][paired]\r\n \r\n[3dhist]: https://liutongzhou.github.io/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Carpooling-Assistant/Visualization%20Results/3dhist.png \"Distribution of Taxi Trips Count\"\r\n[2d frequency]:https://liutongzhou.github.io/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Carpooling-Assistant/Visualization%20Results/Frequency.png \"Taxi Trip Frequency by Location\"\r\n[contour hot]:https://liutongzhou.github.io/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Carpooling-Assistant/Visualization%20Results/Contour.png \"Hot Areas\"\r\n[paired]:https://liutongzhou.github.io/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Carpooling-Assistant/Visualization%20Results/Paired%20Taxi%20Trips%20Busiest%20Region.png \"Paired Trips\"",
